## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Greater Manchester Accidents Data from 2010 to 2021 downloaded from gov.uk to better understand the following:

1. Trend Analysis:
How has the number of accidents in Greater Manchester changed over the years?
Is there any observable trend in the severity of accidents over the years?

2. Vehicle and Casualties:
What is the distribution of the number of vehicles involved in accidents?
What is the distribution of the number of casualties per accident?

3. Temporal Analysis:
Is there any particular day of the week when accidents are more likely to occur?
At what time of the day do most accidents occur?

4. Spatial Analysis:
Are there specific areas (identified by Easting and Northing) with a higher frequency of accidents?
Is there any correlation between accidents and the type of road (Road1Class, CarriagewayType, etc.)?

5. Environmental Factors:
Do accidents occur more often in certain weather conditions or lighting conditions?
How does the road surface condition affect the frequency and severity of accidents?

6. Special Conditions and Hazards:
What are the most common special conditions and carriageway hazards associated with accidents?
Is there a correlation between the presence of pedestrian crossings and the number of accidents?

7. Severity Analysis:
What factors contribute most to severe accidents?
How do road speed limits affect the severity of accidents?

8. Local Authority Analysis:
Is there a difference in accident rates between different local authorities within Greater Manchester?
Do certain local authorities have better safety records than others?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. Additionally, the dataset and data guides used are also available here for your use and guidance.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@m7mad.fhd2030/greater-manchester-road-accidents-analysis-2010-2021-2c742e7acfcc).
